Announcement
This verison harbors significant changed to the previous iterations in terms of mod selection and design philosophy. Please bear that in mind and understand the nature of this alpha is experimental and do not expect to use saves from this version on the launch edition. Alphas will be for will significant mechanics are still missing which impact things like world generation, and betas will be for when there is still minor features which can feasibily added onto worlds where they're missing.

Known Issues
- Stormilla has not been properly updated so expect issues with that, feel free to disable it temproarily. Currently shields are not rendered properly and there have been issues with the Dark Mode UI mainly with the armor slots.
