Minecraft 1.21+ requires Java 21. Update your launcher.

Announcement
This version harbors significant changed to the previous iterations in terms of mod selection and design philosophy. It was planned to update to a newer version, but many mods are still outdated due to the new changes they introduce. As of now there are a few things missing due to incompatibility, but will be added to future versions. Please direct any feedback or issues to the GitHub to be addressed.

Stormilla has a bug where shields do not render properly but I have included an additional pack download that fixes them temporarily until the issue is addressed.

Distant Horizons is included but disabled by default. You can enable it from within the settings, but it may be unstable until they come out with the new release.

Here are some mods removed and the reasoning why:
- LibJF, Polyone & Respackopts: Temporary compatibility issues
- Controlify, Snow Under Trees, Supplementaries, & Zoomify: Incompatible with Distant Horizons currently
- Leaves Us In Peace: Conflicts with Biomes O' Plenty and redundant with Falling Trees
- Lootr: Issues when enabling vanilla textures
- Repurposed Structures: Better alternatives with Hopo's & Yung's mods
- Open Parties & Claims: Causes crashes
- Xaero's Mods: Replaced with Antique Atlas and will add item component when available
